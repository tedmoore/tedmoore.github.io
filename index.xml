Multiphonic Similarity Lookup The main technological idea behind the album was to use a system that would analyze the &amp;ldquo;pitch class content&amp;rdquo; of the feedback cymbal in real-time, find the saxophone multiphonic with the most similar pitch class content, and display it to the saxophonist to perform, (perhaps) blending harmonically with the cymbal (I say perhaps because the microtonality of the cymbal and multiphonics makes for some juicy proximities).</description></item><item><title>_Musical Agents, Agency, &amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding_</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the paper I presented at ICMC 2024 titled, Musical Agents, Agency, &amp;amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding.

abstract:
Creating AI musical agents is an interest to many electronic music artists and researchers. This paper suggests a phenomenological understanding of &amp;ldquo;musical agency&amp;rdquo; determined by four criteria: in order to perceive a technological system as a collaborative agent it must (1) be perceived as separate from the user, (2) be surprising to the user, (3) be intended as a collaborative agent, and (4) mirror the user’s own musical intentions.</description></item><item><title>Adapting _saccades_ for the Allosphere</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</guid><description>published May 15, 2025

Scores of hand-crafted aluminum chimes are placed all throughout the garden. Each is independently agitated by a small DC motor creating varying gestures, trajectories, and timbres. Motion sensors (connected to the motors through a small Arduino controller) trigger added agitation, acknowledging audiences presence and allowing them to participate in shaping the sonic environment. The Arduinos are also be controlled via WiFi enabling the entire system of chimes to be a performative space creating motions and gestures of sound that encompass the space and can adapt to different configuration of chimes and installation sites.</description></item><item><title>APPETITE</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</guid><description>Created in collaboration with theater artist Charles Campbell of Skewed Visions.
​APPETITE uses the principle of feedback (audio, video, and cultural) to create environments that, while structured and intentional, are open, unpredictable, and greater than the elements used in their construction.
The texts in APPETITE use Chris Marker&amp;rsquo;s influential 1962 sci-fi/experimental film, La Jetée as a starting point. Marker&amp;rsquo;s time-travel love-story film is almost entirely made up of a sequence of still images with voice-over narration.</description></item><item><title>APSIS</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</guid><description>composed for and premiered by Strains New Music Ensemble

feed integrates multiple modes of real-time lighting control using custom tools that implement DMX parameterization, machine learning, music information retrieval, and Reaper sequencer integration. My DMX parameter control system is a family of OOP classes written in SuperCollider that can be implemented with any DMX compatible lights.

The feedback in this performance is entirely acoustic and the nodes in the feedback path are the humans in the ensemble. All the performers make quiet sparse sounds throughout the performance, listening to each other in the room and responding differently at different times. At first a series of negative feedback responses regulate the distance of the performers to each other.</description></item><item><title>fiery walls</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</guid><description>“I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair.

it teaches us that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist creates an audio feedback loop by attaching a transducer to a suspended cymbal. The transducer agitates the cymbal with whatever audio signal is coming in through the microphone, which, when placed over the cymbal amplifies the sounds of the cymbal, agitating it further, creating a positive feedback loop. Moving the microphone over different parts of the cymbal and at different distances and angles creates different feedback tones and dynamics.</description></item><item><title>leviathan</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</guid><description>commissioned by Spitting Image Collective

These sounds were transcribed both using computer analysis and by ear and then orchestrated manually.</description></item><item><title>performance and appearance history</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/performances-appearances/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/performances-appearances/</guid><description>8/27/2025 apsis ii Brandon University, performed by Tönky Hönk Manitoba, Canada 6/25/2025 improv SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, with Anne La Berge Kalamazoo, MI 6/25/2025 apsis ii SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, performed by Keith Kirchoff Kalamazoo, MI 6/25/2025 still motion b SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, performed by Ted Moore Kalamazoo, MI 6/25/2025 it teaches us that it doesn&amp;#39;t exist SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, performed by Ted Moore Kalamazoo, MI 6/25/2025 nand SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, performed by SPLICE Ensemble Kalamazoo, MI 6/24/2025 Presentation SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University Kalamazoo, MI 6/22/2025 - 6/28/2025 Featured Guest SPLICE Institute, Western Michigan University, taught SuperCollider &amp;amp; FluCoMa Workshops Kalamazoo, MI 6/22/2025 cylinder lullaby I New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Sheen Center, performed by Maja Cerar New York, NY 6/12/2025 VCV Rack Workshop New Music On the Point Point Counter Point, VT 6/11/2025 Presentation New Music On the Point Point Counter Point, VT 6/11/2025 improv New Music On the Point, with NMOP participants Point Counter Point, VT 6/11/2025 bezier New Music On the Point, performed by Justine Leichtling Point Counter Point, VT 6/11/2025 apsis ii New Music On the Point, performed by Tönky Hönk Point Counter Point, VT 6/9/2025 - 6/13/2025 Faculty New Music On the Point Point Counter Point, VT 6/9/2025 cylinder lullaby I International Computer Music Conference (ICMC), New England Conservatory, performed by Lilit Hartunian Boston, MA 6/7/2025 still motion b Line Upon Line Austin, TX 6/5/2025 - 6/8/2025 Artist Residency Line Upon Line Austin, TX 4/14/2025 Your Data, Your Sound: Personalizing Machine Learning for Musical Creativity Presentation Johns Hopkins Univ.</description></item><item><title>PERSEPHONE</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/persephone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/persephone/</guid><description>PERSEPHONE was created in collaboration with theater artist Hannah K. Holman and tells an interpretation of the Greek myth of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus who became the queen of the underworld after being abducted by Hades. Our retelling explores the themes of fear, curiosity, rebirth, and growth. The music and sound was composed by Ted Moore and the story and movement were devised in collaboration with the cast.</description></item><item><title>quartet</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/quartet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/quartet/</guid><description>created with the [Switch~ Ensemble]:
Zach Sheets, flute
T.J. Borden, cello
Wei-Han Wu, piano
Megan Arns, percussion
quartet is a remote collaboration between myself and the [Switch~ Ensemble] designed to engage with the added technological mediation at play during the pandemic. The sonic source material of quartet is about two minutes of eurorack synthesizer recordings transcribed for the [Switch~ Ensemble] to record. These recordings were then subjected to data analysis using audio descriptors and machine learning algorithms using FluCoMa.</description></item><item><title>saccades</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/saccades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/saccades/</guid><description>A “saccade” is a rapid movement of the eyeball between two fixed focal points. During this brief moment, the brain hides this blurry motion from our perception. Once a saccade motion has begun, the destination cannot change, meaning that if the target of focus disappears the viewer won’t know until the saccade completes. If the field of vision is changing too quickly, the saccades may never be able to arrive at and focus on a target, instead, the objects in view are only perceived through peripheral vision.</description></item><item><title>samara</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/samara/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/samara/</guid><description>samara piece captures the calming stillness of samara seeds (aka. helicopter seeds) that fall in my neighborhood every spring.

The Serge Modular Archive Instrument (created in collaboration with Jean Brazeau) is a sample-based computer emulation of selected patches on the vintage Serge Modular instrument that is housed at Simon Frasier University in Vancouver, Canada. The project is conceived of as both an instrument for sonic exploration and an archive of the sound worlds made by this 50+ year old instrument, including (or highlighting) all of the idiosyncrasies it has accumulated over the years.</description></item><item><title>shadow</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/shadow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/shadow/</guid><description>shadow exists as both a solo version for no-input mixer and lights (performed at Omaha Under the Radar in 2018) and as a duo with saxophone. In this video, shadow was played as one movement of a longer performance on the Frequency Series at Constellation in Chicago.
The sounds of the no-input mixer are analyzed in real-time using timbral descriptors, which are then sent to a neural network for classification into one of four categories: distorted noise, high squeal, low impulses, or quiet sustained noise.</description></item><item><title>Solstice Orrery</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</guid><description>Music composed by Scott Miller: Solstice Orrery on Raba (New Focus Recordings fcr198)
Video design by Ted Moore
Scott asked me to create a video design for this track (Solstice Orrery) on his New Focus release, Raba. An &amp;ldquo;orrery&amp;rdquo; is a mechanical model of the solar system (as can be heard in the music). I took inspiration from the title and used/created images of the sun in various renderings.</description></item><item><title>still motion</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/still-motion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/still-motion/</guid><description>Commissioned by and composed for percussionist Patti Cudd with support from MacPhail Center for Music and the McKnight Foundation.
still motion uses live audio and video sampling of the performing percussionist, the projection of which creates a counterpoint to the live performer. All of the sampling is done with an openFrameworks program coded in C++.

recorded at UT Austin, January 12, 2019
Composing tap began by recording many sounds, gestures, and passages on my eurorack modular synthesizer and then organizing these recordings into a tape part for the piece. I then transcribed the rhythms and timbres of the tape part to create a tight synchronization between the the tape and percussion parts played by the ensemble. The video and lights were then composed to add to the intense synchrony.</description></item><item><title>the curve is exponential</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/the-curve-is-exponential/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/the-curve-is-exponential/</guid><description>commissioned by University of Chicago Carilloneur Joey Brink for the 75th anniversary of the 1st human-controlled self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction
dedicated with much appreciation to Joey Brink
the curve is exponential was written in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the first human-controlled self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The structure of the piece roughly follows the events in the days surrounding the experiment at the University of Chicago in 1942.</description></item><item><title>thread fork thread</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/thread-fork-thread/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/thread-fork-thread/</guid><description>I composed thread fork thread for the International Contemporary Ensemble during their residency at the Walden School in 2015 (which use viola instead of cello).

These images feel like a microscope and a pause button, allowing us to sit with one moment in time, look at it very closely, in a new way, and appreciate the specificity, detail, and care it can convey.</description></item><item><title>triangle</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/triangle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/triangle/</guid><description>Commissioned by National Sawdust
