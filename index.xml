During performance, the feedback cymbal&amp;rsquo;s audio is analyzed for chroma and in real-time compared to recordings of the instrumetalist&amp;rsquo;s multiphonics (that were recorded and analyzed earlier). The multiphonic most similar to the current cymbal timbre is displayed on a screen for the instrumentalist, who may choose to either play the displayed multiphonic or deviate from it, as the musical moment offers.</description></item><item><title>Aluminum Forest</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/aluminum-forest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/aluminum-forest/</guid><description>created in collaboration with Katherine Balch.
Scores of hand-crafted aluminum chimes are placed all throughout the garden. Each is independently agitated by a small DC motor creating varying gestures, trajectories, and timbres. Motion sensors (connected to the motors through a small Arduino controller) trigger added agitation, acknowledging audiences presence and allowing them to participate in shaping the sonic environment. The Arduinos are also be controlled via WiFi enabling the entire system of chimes to be a performative space creating motions and gestures of sound that encompass the garden and can adapt to different configuration of chimes and installation sites.</description></item><item><title>APPETITE</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</guid><description>Created in collaboration with theater artist Charles Campbell of Skewed Visions.
​APPETITE uses the principle of feedback (audio, video, and cultural) to create environments that, while structured and intentional, are open, unpredictable, and greater than the elements used in their construction.
The texts in APPETITE use Chris Marker&amp;rsquo;s influential 1962 sci-fi/experimental film, La Jetée as a starting point. Marker&amp;rsquo;s time-travel love-story film is almost entirely made up of a sequence of still images with voice-over narration.</description></item><item><title>APSIS</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</guid><description>composed for and premiered by Strains New Music Ensemble

With it, the water in the cones agitate and reflect light into shimmering patterns on the walls and ceiling. The minimalist presentation draws a strong causal relationship between all of the elements in the room: sound, water, light, and the physical functionality of speakers.</description></item><item><title>Binary Canary</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/binary-canary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/binary-canary/</guid><description> Binary Canary is a saxophone &amp;amp; electronics duo comprised of Ted Moore and Kyle Hutchins that we started in 2014.

The piece includes live audio processing using SuperCollider, as well as live visuals created with Processing. The visuals are controlled by the audio of the performer, giving the freedom to improvise within the structure specified by the composer, but keeping the visual and musical elements intimately connected through gesture.</description></item><item><title>FEATHERMUCKER</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feathermucker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feathermucker/</guid><description>FEATHERMUCKER by Ted Moore featuring The Dream Songs Project with text by Timothy Otte text by Timothy Otte
Commissioned by The Dream Songs Project
Over the work’s 50 minute duration, Timothy Otte’s text sets a crumbled, post-apocalyptic world in which he describes the creative process of making idiosyncratic meaning where objective meaning cannot be found. Musically, FEATHERMUCKER is a combination of folk, experimental, and electronic music; cinematic sound fx; and sound art installation.</description></item><item><title>feed</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</guid><description>feed was created in collaboration with bassoonist Ben Roidl-Ward for Experimental Sound Studio&amp;rsquo;s Oscillation Series.
feed integrates multiple modes of real-time lighting control using custom tools that implement DMX parameterization, machine learning, music information retrieval, and Reaper sequencer integration. My DMX parameter control system is a family of OOP classes written in SuperCollider that can be implemented with any DMX compatible lights. It allows for user-defined parameter naming and contains built-in timed fades, LFO modulation, control bus following (for audio reactivity), and user-defined function control of individual parameters.</description></item><item><title>feedback V</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feedback-v/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feedback-v/</guid><description>feedback V is part of a series of works that use feedback systems in various ways. The feedback in this performance is entirely acoustic and the nodes in the feedback path are the humans in the ensemble. All the performers make quiet sparse sounds throughout the performance, listening to each other in the room and responding differently at different times. At first a series of negative feedback responses regulate the distance of the performers to each other.</description></item><item><title>fiery walls</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</guid><description>“I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink—I averted my eyes—…There was a discordant hum of voices! There was a loud blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders!”

FluCoMa enables techno-fluent musicians to integrate machine listening and machine learning in their creative practice within Max, SuperCollider, and Pure Data. The toolkit offers tools to separate audio into component parts including slicers and spectral decomposition algorithms, audio analysis tools to describe audio components as analytical and statistical representations, data analysis and machine learning algorithms for pattern detection and expressive dataset browsing, and audio morphing and hybridization algorithms for audio remixing, interpolating, and variation-making.</description></item><item><title>for line upon line</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/for-line-upon-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/for-line-upon-line/</guid><description>My friends at line upon line percussion asked me to come up with an idea for a short piece that could be created collaboratively with them during the COVID time of physical distancing. In turn, I asked for videos of them making a collection of sounds that I could then combine into some groovy video thing.
The videos are played using custom software in c++ created with openframeworks, however all of the sequencing was done with patterns in SuperCollider.</description></item><item><title>Gilgamesh &amp; Enkidu</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/gilgamesh-enkidu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/gilgamesh-enkidu/</guid><description>Commissioned by the Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis.</description></item><item><title>hold</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/hold/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/hold/</guid><description>hold is a tape composition commissioned by Chicago Civic Orchestra for their 100 year anniversary live stream, March 29, 2020. It was created using samples of individual orchestra members playing their part to Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s 5th symphony along with other electronic sounds, including feedback bassoon sounds made with collaborator Ben Roidl-Ward.
This work is not only to celebrate Civic&amp;rsquo;s 100 year history, but is also a reflection on the COVID-19 crisis, which is the reason the event was changed from a live performance to a live stream.</description></item><item><title>hollow</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/hollow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/hollow/</guid><description>hollow was created in collaboration with saxophonist Kyle Hutchins and is featured on Binary Canary&amp;rsquo;s album iterative systems out on Carrier Records.
Three large PVC tubes (4 inches in diameter and between 7 and 10 feet long–they can be seen in the video) are amplified by placing a microphone on one end and a speaker on the other.

it teaches us that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist creates an audio feedback loop by attaching a transducer to a suspended cymbal. The transducer agitates the cymbal with whatever audio signal is coming in through the microphone, which, when placed over the cymbal amplifies the sounds of the cymbal, agitating it further, creating a positive feedback loop. Moving the microphone over different parts of the cymbal and at different distances and angles creates different feedback tones and dynamics.</description></item><item><title>leviathan</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</guid><description>commissioned by Spitting Image Collective
composed for Sarah Porwoll-Lee
leviathan embodies the sonic world that one might hear in a littoral cave. The work was inspired by An Uaimh Bhinn, a cave on the Scottish coast famous for its unique harmonic resonances. The reverb used in the piece is modeled on the impulse response of a cavern; the vases serve as harmonic resonators through which many sounds are processed live, including the swell of ocean waves and the bass clarinet.</description></item><item><title>Microtonal Keyboard</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/research/microtonal-keyboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/research/microtonal-keyboard/</guid><description> Commissioned by composer Katie Balch, this application allows for microtonal adjustment of each note +/-50 cents. It can be connected to and played by a MIDI keyboard as well as with a QWERTY keyboard for quick and easy use. Tunings can be saved as files and recalled for continued use on multiple projects.

It is based on a system of routing audio through processing modules and maximal flexibility of control with any MIDI or OSC devices. The primary use is live laptop improvisation, but it is also used as a framework for executing performances of my compositions. The conceptual structuring of this software is based on the research of laptop improviser Sam Pluta.</description></item><item><title>Moore/Sellwood Tour</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/moore-sellwood-tour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/moore-sellwood-tour/</guid><description>New York City Wednesday, January 4, 2023

quartet is a remote collaboration between myself and the [Switch~ Ensemble] designed to engage with the added technological mediation at play during the pandemic. The sonic source material of quartet is about two minutes of eurorack synthesizer recordings transcribed for the [Switch~ Ensemble] to record.</description></item><item><title>saccades</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/saccades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/saccades/</guid><description>A “saccade” is a rapid movement of the eyeball between two fixed focal points. During this brief moment, the brain hides this blurry motion from our perception. Once a saccade motion has begun, the destination cannot change, meaning that if the target of focus disappears the viewer won’t know until the saccade completes. If the field of vision is changing too quickly, the saccades may never be able to arrive at and focus on a target, instead, the objects in view are only perceived through peripheral vision.</description></item><item><title>samara</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/samara/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/samara/</guid><description>samara piece captures the calming stillness of samara seeds (aka. helicopter seeds) that fall in my neighborhood every spring.

The Serge Modular Archive Instrument (created in collaboration with Jean Brazeau) is a sample-based computer emulation of selected patches on the vintage Serge Modular instrument that is housed at Simon Frasier University in Vancouver, Canada. The project is conceived of as both an instrument for sonic exploration and an archive of the sound worlds made by this 50+ year old instrument, including (or highlighting) all of the idiosyncrasies it has accumulated over the years.</description></item><item><title>shadow</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/shadow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/shadow/</guid><description>shadow exists as both a solo version for no-input mixer and lights (performed at Omaha Under the Radar in 2018) and as a duo with saxophone. In this video, shadow was played as one movement of a longer performance on the Frequency Series at Constellation in Chicago.
The sounds of the no-input mixer are analyzed in real-time using timbral descriptors, which are then sent to a neural network for classification into one of four categories: distorted noise, high squeal, low impulses, or quiet sustained noise.</description></item><item><title>Solstice Orrery</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</guid><description>Music composed by Scott Miller: Solstice Orrery on Raba (New Focus Recordings fcr198)

recorded at UT Austin, January 12, 2019
Composing tap began by recording many sounds, gestures, and passages on my eurorack modular synthesizer and then organizing these recordings into a tape part for the piece. I then transcribed the rhythms and timbres of the tape part to create a tight synchronization between the the tape and percussion parts played by the ensemble. The video and lights were then composed to add to the intense synchrony.</description></item><item><title>the curve is exponential</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/the-curve-is-exponential/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/the-curve-is-exponential/</guid><description>commissioned by University of Chicago Carilloneur Joey Brink for the 75th anniversary of the 1st human-controlled self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction
