During performance, the feedback cymbal&amp;rsquo;s audio is analyzed for chroma and in real-time compared to recordings of the instrumetalist&amp;rsquo;s multiphonics (that were recorded and analyzed earlier). The multiphonic most similar to the current cymbal timbre is displayed on a screen for the instrumentalist, who may choose to either play the displayed multiphonic or deviate from it, as the musical moment offers.</description></item><item><title>Aluminum Forest</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/aluminum-forest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/aluminum-forest/</guid><description>created in collaboration with Katherine Balch.
Scores of hand-crafted aluminum chimes are placed all throughout the garden. Each is independently agitated by a small DC motor creating varying gestures, trajectories, and timbres. Motion sensors (connected to the motors through a small Arduino controller) trigger added agitation, acknowledging audiences presence and allowing them to participate in shaping the sonic environment. The Arduinos are also be controlled via WiFi enabling the entire system of chimes to be a performative space creating motions and gestures of sound that encompass the garden and can adapt to different configuration of chimes and installation sites.</description></item><item><title>APPETITE</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/appetite/</guid><description>Created in collaboration with theater artist Charles Campbell of Skewed Visions.
​APPETITE uses the principle of feedback (audio, video, and cultural) to create environments that, while structured and intentional, are open, unpredictable, and greater than the elements used in their construction.
The texts in APPETITE use Chris Marker&amp;rsquo;s influential 1962 sci-fi/experimental film, La Jetée as a starting point. Marker&amp;rsquo;s time-travel love-story film is almost entirely made up of a sequence of still images with voice-over narration.</description></item><item><title>APSIS</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</guid><description>composed for and premiered by Strains New Music Ensemble

With it, the water in the cones agitate and reflect light into shimmering patterns on the walls and ceiling. The minimalist presentation draws a strong causal relationship between all of the elements in the room: sound, water, light, and the physical functionality of speakers.</description></item><item><title>Binary Canary</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/binary-canary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/binary-canary/</guid><description> Binary Canary is a saxophone &amp;amp; electronics duo comprised of Ted Moore and Kyle Hutchins that we started in 2014.

Commissioned by The Dream Songs Project
Over the work’s 50 minute duration, Timothy Otte’s text sets a crumbled, post-apocalyptic world in which he describes the creative process of making idiosyncratic meaning where objective meaning cannot be found. Musically, FEATHERMUCKER is a combination of folk, experimental, and electronic music; cinematic sound fx; and sound art installation.</description></item><item><title>feed</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</guid><description>feed was created in collaboration with bassoonist Ben Roidl-Ward for Experimental Sound Studio&amp;rsquo;s Oscillation Series.
feed integrates multiple modes of real-time lighting control using custom tools that implement DMX parameterization, machine learning, music information retrieval, and Reaper sequencer integration. My DMX parameter control system is a family of OOP classes written in SuperCollider that can be implemented with any DMX compatible lights. It allows for user-defined parameter naming and contains built-in timed fades, LFO modulation, control bus following (for audio reactivity), and user-defined function control of individual parameters.</description></item><item><title>feedback V</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feedback-v/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feedback-v/</guid><description>feedback V is part of a series of works that use feedback systems in various ways. The feedback in this performance is entirely acoustic and the nodes in the feedback path are the humans in the ensemble. All the performers make quiet sparse sounds throughout the performance, listening to each other in the room and responding differently at different times. At first a series of negative feedback responses regulate the distance of the performers to each other.</description></item><item><title>fiery walls</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/fiery-walls/</guid><description>“I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair.

it teaches us that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist creates an audio feedback loop by attaching a transducer to a suspended cymbal. The transducer agitates the cymbal with whatever audio signal is coming in through the microphone, which, when placed over the cymbal amplifies the sounds of the cymbal, agitating it further, creating a positive feedback loop. Moving the microphone over different parts of the cymbal and at different distances and angles creates different feedback tones and dynamics.</description></item><item><title>leviathan</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/leviathan/</guid><description>commissioned by Spitting Image Collective

leviathan embodies the sonic world that one might hear in a littoral cave. The work was inspired by An Uaimh Bhinn, a cave on the Scottish coast famous for its unique harmonic resonances. The reverb used in the piece is modeled on the impulse response of a cavern; the vases serve as harmonic resonators through which many sounds are processed live, including the swell of ocean waves and the bass clarinet.</description></item><item><title>Module Tensor</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/research/module-tensor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/research/module-tensor/</guid><description>Module Tensor is the custom software I coded in SuperCollider and use to improvise on live electronics. It is based on a system of routing audio through processing modules and maximal flexibility of control with any MIDI or OSC devices.
