    caption: "From one polygon in A, I'll need to determine the distance to every polygon in B."

    caption: "And I'll need to do that for each polygon in A."

    caption: "I make a distance matrix, or 'cost matrix', to compare the distance from every polygon in A to every polygon in B."

    caption: "I then use the Munkres algorithm to find the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost (total sum distance of all the polygons' travel)."
