    caption: "Their vertices could be ordered starting anywhere."

    caption: "Leading to undesirable morphs between points that are not near each other."

    caption: "I would prefer something like this. Where points in similar positions (around the polygon) morph between each other."

    caption: "So I want a way to automatically reorder them to something like this."

    caption: "If I treat the centroid as the origin of an x,y plane..."

    caption: "And connect each vertex to the centroid..."

    caption: "I can compute the angle of that vector as some distance \"around\" the unit circle."
  - src: "/images/morph-polygons/42-sort-vertices.jpg"
    caption: "Then I sort the vertices by that angle."

    caption: "If I do that for all the polygons, I can be sure that the points will generally be in similar positions and the morph will look better."
