    caption: "Initially all of the polygons moved in sync, so they would all 'depart' and 'arrive' at the same time."

    caption: "Each trajectory is given a random amount their timing should be offset from the global time."

    caption: "The random timing offsets were determined using a normal distribution so for big movements, at first a few polygons would move, then many, then again just a few at the end."
