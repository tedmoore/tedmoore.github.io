    caption: "When the polygons traversed across the three screens, I didn't like how linear it was."

    caption: "So I gave each traversal a hidden line (purple) that it would use to make the traversal less linear."

    caption: "As the polygon makes the long traversal across the three screens it 'swerves' towards and then away from the purple line."

    caption: "Each trajectory's traversal got a different 'swerve' line randomly provided with a normal distribution for the starting and stopping point along vertical edges of the video."
