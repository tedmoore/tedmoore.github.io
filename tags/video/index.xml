​APPETITE uses the principle of feedback (audio, video, and cultural) to create environments that, while structured and intentional, are open, unpredictable, and greater than the elements used in their construction.
The texts in APPETITE use Chris Marker&amp;rsquo;s influential 1962 sci-fi/experimental film, La Jetée as a starting point. Marker&amp;rsquo;s time-travel love-story film is almost entirely made up of a sequence of still images with voice-over narration.</description></item><item><title>APSIS</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/apsis/</guid><description>composed for and premiered by Strains New Music Ensemble

The piece includes live audio processing using SuperCollider, as well as live visuals created with Processing. The visuals are controlled by the audio of the performer, giving the freedom to improvise within the structure specified by the composer, but keeping the visual and musical elements intimately connected through gesture.</description></item><item><title>for line upon line</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/for-line-upon-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/for-line-upon-line/</guid><description>My friends at line upon line percussion asked me to come up with an idea for a short piece that could be created collaboratively with them during the COVID time of physical distancing. In turn, I asked for videos of them making a collection of sounds that I could then combine into some groovy video thing.
The videos are played using custom software in c++ created with openframeworks, however all of the sequencing was done with patterns in SuperCollider.</description></item><item><title>noise/gate</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/noise-gate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/noise-gate/</guid><description> Composed for Giacomo Piermatti of Ensemble Suono Giallo for ilSuono Contemporary Music Week 2021.

created with the [Switch~ Ensemble]:
Zach Sheets, flute
T.J. Borden, cello
Wei-Han Wu, piano
Megan Arns, percussion
quartet is a remote collaboration between myself and the [Switch~ Ensemble] designed to engage with the added technological mediation at play during the pandemic. The sonic source material of quartet is about two minutes of eurorack synthesizer recordings transcribed for the [Switch~ Ensemble] to record.</description></item><item><title>Solstice Orrery</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/solstice-orrery/</guid><description>Music composed by Scott Miller: Solstice Orrery on Raba (New Focus Recordings fcr198)
Video design by Ted Moore
Scott asked me to create a video design for this track (Solstice Orrery) on his New Focus release, Raba. An &amp;ldquo;orrery&amp;rdquo; is a mechanical model of the solar system (as can be heard in the music). I took inspiration from the title and used/created images of the sun in various renderings.</description></item><item><title>still motion</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/still-motion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/still-motion/</guid><description>Commissioned by and composed for percussionist Patti Cudd with support from MacPhail Center for Music and the McKnight Foundation.
still motion uses live audio and video sampling of the performing percussionist, the projection of which creates a counterpoint to the live performer. All of the sampling is done with an openFrameworks program coded in C++.

recorded at UT Austin, January 12, 2019
Composing tap began by recording many sounds, gestures, and passages on my eurorack modular synthesizer and then organizing these recordings into a tape part for the piece. I then transcribed the rhythms and timbres of the tape part to create a tight synchronization between the the tape and percussion parts played by the ensemble. The video and lights were then composed to add to the intense synchrony.</description></item></channel></rss>
