The DMX lights were composed and sequenced using a custom protocol between Reaper and SuperCollider.
This is a stereo mixdown.</description></item><item><title>feed</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/feed/</guid><description>feed was created in collaboration with bassoonist Ben Roidl-Ward for Experimental Sound Studio&amp;rsquo;s Oscillation Series.
feed integrates multiple modes of real-time lighting control using custom tools that implement DMX parameterization, machine learning, music information retrieval, and Reaper sequencer integration. My DMX parameter control system is a family of OOP classes written in SuperCollider that can be implemented with any DMX compatible lights. It allows for user-defined parameter naming and contains built-in timed fades, LFO modulation, control bus following (for audio reactivity), and user-defined function control of individual parameters.</description></item></channel></rss>
