​APPETITE uses the principle of feedback (audio, video, and cultural) to create environments that, while structured and intentional, are open, unpredictable, and greater than the elements used in their construction.
The texts in APPETITE use Chris Marker&amp;rsquo;s influential 1962 sci-fi/experimental film, La Jetée as a starting point. Marker&amp;rsquo;s time-travel love-story film is almost entirely made up of a sequence of still images with voice-over narration.</description></item><item><title>PERSEPHONE</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/persephone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/works/persephone/</guid><description>PERSEPHONE was created in collaboration with theater artist Hannah K. Holman and tells an interpretation of the Greek myth of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus who became the queen of the underworld after being abducted by Hades. Our retelling explores the themes of fear, curiosity, rebirth, and growth. The music and sound was composed by Ted Moore and the story and movement were devised in collaboration with the cast.</description></item></channel></rss>
