During performance, the feedback cymbal&amp;rsquo;s audio is analyzed for chroma and in real-time compared to recordings of the instrumetalist&amp;rsquo;s multiphonics (that were recorded and analyzed earlier). The multiphonic most similar to the current cymbal timbre is displayed on a screen for the instrumentalist, who may choose to either play the displayed multiphonic or deviate from it, as the musical moment offers.</description></item></channel></rss>
