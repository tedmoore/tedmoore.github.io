My paper described a process creating an audio reactive video (for the fourth movement of arco) using some machine learning in an attempt to intimately link the audio and video morphologies.

Track 1 from alloy:
Your browser does not support the audio element. see the code referenced below.
Multiphonic Similarity Lookup The main technological idea behind the album was to use a system that would analyze the &amp;ldquo;pitch class content&amp;rdquo; of the feedback cymbal in real-time, find the saxophone multiphonic with the most similar pitch class content, and display it to the saxophonist to perform, (perhaps) blending harmonically with the cymbal (I say perhaps because the microtonality of the cymbal and multiphonics makes for some juicy proximities).</description></item><item><title>_Musical Agents, Agency, &amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding_</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the paper I presented at ICMC 2024 titled, Musical Agents, Agency, &amp;amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding.

abstract:
Creating AI musical agents is an interest to many electronic music artists and researchers. This paper suggests a phenomenological understanding of &amp;ldquo;musical agency&amp;rdquo; determined by four criteria: in order to perceive a technological system as a collaborative agent it must (1) be perceived as separate from the user, (2) be surprising to the user, (3) be intended as a collaborative agent, and (4) mirror the userâ€™s own musical intentions.</description></item><item><title>Adapting _saccades_ for the Allosphere</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</guid><description>published May 15, 2025
In spring of 2024 I was asked to present saccades in the Allosphere: a three-story, 360 degree video sphere with 54 channel surround sound at UC Santa Barbara. The audience watches from a bridge that goes directly through the middle of the sphere. My saxophone-playing collaborator Kyle Hutchins was doing a west coast tour and though it would be cool to bring saccades to this very tech-forward space.</description></item><item><title>Creating *quartet*</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/creating-quartet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/creating-quartet/</guid><description>published May 15, 2025
I created quartet in collaboration with the [Switch Ensemble~] for the 2021 SEAMUS Conference which was held online because of the pandemic. Because I knew that the work&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;premiere&amp;rdquo; would be held as a prerecorded video concert on YouTube, I decided to approach the work not as a live, electro-acoustic composition, but as a fixed-media, video-art piece that made use of the of the necessary technological mediation at play.</description></item><item><title>The Harmonic Series Strikes Again</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/harmonic-series-strikes-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/harmonic-series-strikes-again/</guid><description>published May 17, 2025
My composition hollow, includes large PVC tubes that are used in a complex audio feedback system. The three tubes (all four inches in diameter) are cut to lengths of 10 feet, 8.4 feet, and 7.5 feet in order to achieve resonances at 55.8 Hz (~A1), 66.3 Hz (~C2), and 74.4 Hz (~D2) respectively.
A recording of a performance of hollow was used as the tape part in the fifth movement of arco.</description></item></channel></rss>
