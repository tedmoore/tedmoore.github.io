Multiphonic Similarity Lookup The main technological idea behind the album was to use a system that would analyze the &amp;ldquo;pitch class content&amp;rdquo; of the feedback cymbal in real-time, find the saxophone multiphonic with the most similar pitch class content, and display it to the saxophonist to perform, (perhaps) blending harmonically with the cymbal (I say perhaps because the microtonality of the cymbal and multiphonics makes for some juicy proximities).</description></item><item><title>_Musical Agents, Agency, &amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding_</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/agency/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the paper I presented at ICMC 2024 titled, Musical Agents, Agency, &amp;amp; AI: Towards a Phenomenological Understanding.

abstract:
Creating AI musical agents is an interest to many electronic music artists and researchers. This paper suggests a phenomenological understanding of &amp;ldquo;musical agency&amp;rdquo; determined by four criteria: in order to perceive a technological system as a collaborative agent it must (1) be perceived as separate from the user, (2) be surprising to the user, (3) be intended as a collaborative agent, and (4) mirror the userâ€™s own musical intentions.</description></item><item><title>Adapting _saccades_ for the Allosphere</title><link>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tedmoore.github.io/blog/allosphere/</guid><description>In spring of 2024 I was asked to present saccades in the Allosphere: a three-story, 360 degree video sphere with 54 channel surround sound at UC Santa Barbara. The audience watches from a bridge that goes directly through the middle of the sphere. My saxophone-playing collaborator Kyle Hutchins was doing a west coast tour and though it would be cool to bring saccades to this very tech-forward space.</description></item></channel></rss>
