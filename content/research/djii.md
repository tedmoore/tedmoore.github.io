_Pronounced like the letter "G"_

DJII was designed by {{< el "Dana Jessen" "https://www.danajessen.com/" >}} and Ted Moore during 2021-2022 and coded by Ted Moore in {{< el "SuperCollider" "https://supercollider.github.io/" >}}. The software is designed to be used by an improvising solo musician as supporting electronics material.

* The modular GUI design allows for intuitive exploration of sound possibilities including flexible matrix-based routing.
* Software-wide state save and recall enables performer navigation through different preplanned sections of a performance. 
* A Transitions panel allows for time-variable, interpolated transitions between states.
* MIDI and QWERTY Learn functionality allows for all of the appropriate controls to be custom-mapped onto controllers accessible to the soloist during performance.
* Saving and loading the software allows the performer to prepare all of the above functionalities before the performance, which: 
  - greatly reduces setup time at the gig, 
  - allows a performer to work on multiple software configurations in parallel, possibly for different performances or contexts, and
  - allows a performer to rehearse with the same configuration of the software over time, developing an intuitive relationship with it and access to the musical expressivity that comes through practice.
