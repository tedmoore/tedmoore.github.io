Commissioned by composer {{< el "Katie Balch" "https://www.katherinebalch.com/" >}}, this application allows for microtonal adjustment of each note +/-50 cents. It can be connected to and played by a MIDI keyboard as well as with a QWERTY keyboard for quick and easy use. Tunings can be saved as files and recalled for continued use on multiple projects.
