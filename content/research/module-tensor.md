_Module Tensor_ is the custom software I coded in SuperCollider and use to [improvise](/improv) on live electronics.  It is based on a system of routing audio through processing modules and maximal flexibility of control with any MIDI or OSC devices. The primary use is live laptop improvisation, but it is also used as a framework for executing performances of my compositions. The conceptual structuring of this software is based on the research of laptop improviser {{< el "Sam Pluta" "http://sampluta.com/" >}}.

Because it is in constant development, the software is not currently available for distribution.
