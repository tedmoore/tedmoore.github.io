In September 2025, I presented a paper at the [6th Artificial Intelligence and Music Creativity Conference](https://aimusiccreativity.org/2025/), which was held in Brussels Belgium. My paper described a process creating an audio reactive video (for the fourth movement of [*arco*](/works/arco)) using some machine learning in an attempt to intimately link the audio and video morphologies.
