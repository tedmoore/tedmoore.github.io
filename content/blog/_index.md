A blog, or something like it. These posts aren't very frequency, just when I think there's something interesting to share about my work that is best conveyed in prose.

The dates are not necessarily when I *write* them; these entries might be back dated to when I worked on these ideas. If the entry was written at a time different from when the ideas were pursued, it will indicate at the top of the entry.

If you have any questions or find things in here that could be made more clear, please [get in touch](/about-contact/).
