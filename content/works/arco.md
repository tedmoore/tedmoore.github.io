_arco_ was motivated by an suggestion from violinist Marco Fusi to create a solo violin version of my work [_triangle_](/works/triangle) for string quartet and tape. I liked the idea but felt that it would make more sense alongside additional movements to provide some context and commentary on this solo version. _arco_ is a five movement work of which the solo version of _triangle_ is movement four. I also created video designs to accompany the violinist and tape parts. I consider the whole suite a song cycle for violin to "sing" in the context of the lush and noisy and harsh and drone-y tape parts.
