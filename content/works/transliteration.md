My _transliteration_ project is a book series that visualizes digital audio using different representations, such as waveforms, binary data, or fourier transformations. These images feel like a microscope and a pause button, allowing us to sit with one moment in time, look at it very closely, in a new way, and appreciate the specificity, detail, and care it can convey.
