My friends at {{< el "line upon line percussion" "https://www.lineuponlinepercussion.org/" >}} asked me to come up with an idea for a short piece that could be created collaboratively with them during the COVID time of physical distancing. In turn, I asked for videos of them making a collection of sounds that I could then combine into some groovy video thing.

The videos are played using custom software in c++ created with {{< el "openframeworks" "https://openframeworks.cc/" >}}, however all of the sequencing was done with patterns in {{< el "SuperCollider" "https://supercollider.github.io/" >}}.
