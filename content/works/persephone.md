_PERSEPHONE_ was created in collaboration with theater artist {{< el "Hannah K. Holman" "https://www.hannahkholman.com/" >}} and tells an interpretation of the Greek myth of Persephone, the daughter of Zeus who became the queen of the underworld after being abducted by Hades. Our retelling explores the themes of fear, curiosity, rebirth, and growth. The music and sound was composed by Ted Moore and the story and movement were devised in collaboration with the cast.

Premiered December 2014 at the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
