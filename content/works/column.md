The spatialized sounds used were designed using custom spatialization algorithms (tuned to the space) and custom sound design software created in {{< el "SuperCollider" "https://supercollider.github.io/" >}}.

The DMX lights were composed and sequenced using a custom protocol between Reaper and {{< el "SuperCollider" "https://supercollider.github.io/" >}}.

This is a stereo mixdown.
