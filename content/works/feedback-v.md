_feedback V_ is part of a series of works that use feedback systems in various ways. The feedback in this performance is entirely acoustic and the nodes in the feedback path are the humans in the ensemble. All the performers make quiet sparse sounds throughout the performance, listening to each other in the room and responding differently at different times. At first a series of negative feedback responses regulate the distance of the performers to each other. Towards the end of the performance, positive feedback brings the ensemble back together. See the score for details.
