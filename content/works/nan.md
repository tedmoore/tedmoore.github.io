_nan_ is an audio-visual composition based on the timbre and rhythmic gating of the NAND-gate feedback circuit described by Nick Collins in _Handmade Electronic Music_. Even though the system is quite simple (producing repeating phrases consisting of square waves, filtered noise, and silence), each gesture has microvariations that increase the entropy and attract my attention endlessly. My favorite timbres from this circuit occur while parameters are being changed–when capacitors are firing at surprising times, before they can settle into a stasis.

Large datasets of audio analyses derived from the tape part are sent to machine learning algorithms to find patterns and then visualize and sonify what is found. A plethora of variations on visual themes are created by the combinatorics of stochastically triggered visual synthesis modules and processing effects. Computer vision analysis adds layers to our visual and aural perception–tightly binding together the visual and auditory elements.

[_nand_](/works/nand) is a version of the piece that also includes instrumentalists.
