_“I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink—I averted my eyes—…There was a discordant hum of voices! There was a loud blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders!”_  
—Edgar Allan Poe, The Pit and the Pendulum
