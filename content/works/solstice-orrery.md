**Music composed by {{< el "Scott Miller" "https://www.scottlmiller.net/" >}}**: _Solstice Orrery_ on {{% el "_Raba_" "https://www.newfocusrecordings.com/catalogue/scott-l-miller-raba/" %}} (New Focus Recordings fcr198)

**Video design by Ted Moore**

Scott asked me to create a video design for this track (_Solstice Orrery_) on his New Focus release, _Raba_. An "orrery" is a mechanical model of the solar system (as can be heard in the music). I took inspiration from the title and used/created images of the sun in various renderings. Scott sent me the individual stems of the audio so I could analyze them and make a video that could respond to the different parts of the sounds in different ways. The audio analyses were done in {{< el "SuperCollider" "https://supercollider.github.io/" >}} and the animation was coded and rendered in Processing.
