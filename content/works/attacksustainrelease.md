At the pace of one taking deep breaths, brown noise swells in and out of each suspended raw speaker cone in an unpredictable pattern.  With it, the water in the cones agitate and reflect light into shimmering patterns on the walls and ceiling.  The minimalist presentation draws a strong causal relationship between all of the elements in the room: sound, water, light, and the physical functionality of speakers.  The simplicity of the relationships is intended to push the observer beyond any technical wonder and relate to the piece on an intuitive and emotional level.
