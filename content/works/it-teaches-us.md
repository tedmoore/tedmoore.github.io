_it teaches us that it doesn't exist_ creates an audio feedback loop by attaching a transducer to a suspended cymbal. The transducer agitates the cymbal with whatever audio signal is coming in through the microphone, which, when placed over the cymbal amplifies the sounds of the cymbal, agitating it further, creating a positive feedback loop. Moving the microphone over different parts of the cymbal and at different distances and angles creates different feedback tones and dynamics. While it is difficult to reproduce exact pitches with this instrument, the score directs patterns of repetition, variation, timing, dynamics, gesture, and texture.
