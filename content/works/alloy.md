_alloy_ uses the same feedback cymbal setup as in my solo work [_it teaches us that it doesn't exist_](/works/it-teaches-us), however this duo also includes an instrument that can produce multiphonics. During performance, the feedback cymbal's audio is analyzed for {{< el chroma "https://learn.flucoma.org/reference/chroma/" >}} and in real-time compared to recordings of the instrumetalist's multiphonics (that were recorded and analyzed earlier). The multiphonic most similar to the current cymbal timbre is displayed on a screen for the instrumentalist, who may choose to either play the displayed multiphonic or deviate from it, as the musical moment offers.

Because different instruments produce varied mutliphonics and different cymbals will produce quite different spectra, the score guides the performers through a series of movements distinguished by different modes of listening and responding to the cymbal, the multiphonic-matching system, and each other. In all the movements, the musicality of the moment is the most important facet to listen for, respond to, and pursue.

Although _alloy_ has only been performed with saxophone, any multiphonic-producing instrument will work, so please get in touch if you'd like to render a version for a different instrument.
