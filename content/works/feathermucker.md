Over the work’s 50 minute duration, Timothy Otte’s text sets a crumbled, post-apocalyptic world in which he describes the creative process of making idiosyncratic meaning where objective meaning cannot be found. Musically, _FEATHERMUCKER_ is a combination of folk, experimental, and electronic music; cinematic sound fx; and sound art installation. The varied genres represented in _FEATHERMUCKER_ mimic the varied tones and forms in the poetry. The musical and textual themes are constantly being recast in new contexts, forcing a listener to be constantly revising one’s understanding of the material. The middle section of the work features a solo for feeding-back guitar, which, through live processing, gives a sound often considered harsh a rebirth into something beautiful.

This commission was made possible by the voters of Minnesota through grants from the Minnesota State Arts Board and the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council, thanks to a legislative appropriation from the arts and cultural heritage fund.
