_hold_ is a tape composition commissioned by Chicago Civic Orchestra for their 100 year anniversary live stream, March 29, 2020. It was created using samples of individual orchestra members playing their part to Tchaikovsky's 5th symphony along with other electronic sounds, including feedback bassoon sounds made with collaborator {{< el "Ben Roidl-Ward" "https://www.benroidlward.com/" >}}.

This work is not only to celebrate Civic's 100 year history, but is also a reflection on the COVID-19 crisis, which is the reason the event was changed from a live performance to a live stream.

_hold_ is meant to express the loss and frustration of so many arts activities that were put on hold, the millions of people who experienced a hard time holding on financially during and after the crisis, and a suggested way of comforting each other during difficult times.
