# [_triangle_](/works/triangle) (2020)  
for string quartet and tape  
performed by JACK quartet

**​[full score](/scores/0_triangle_by_ted_moore_-_score.pdf)**

_triangle_ is part of a series of pieces in which I have been composing explicit translations between the electronic and acoustic sounds. For triangle, I first constructed the tape part from excerpts of my electronic improvisation performances. I then transcribed the electronic sounds and scored them for string quartet. When the acoustic and electronic sounds occur in tight synchronicity, I like how my ear is sometimes tricked or confused into which sound source is being heard.

# [_quartet_](/works/quartet) (2021)  
for flute, percussion, piano, and cello with video processing  
created in collaboration with the [Switch~ Ensemble]

**[score of transcribed source material](/scores/quartet.pdf)**

The sonic source material of _quartet_ is about two minutes of eurorack synthesizer recordings transcribed for the ensemble to record. These recordings were then subjected to analysis using audio descriptors and machine learning algorithms (PCA, UMAP, K Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks). Approaching these acoustic and electronic sounds as data for comparison and manipulation offered me new strategies for combining the material in expressive ways, finding form, and creating sonic relationships and audio-visual objects that I wouldn’t otherwise consider.

# [improvisation](/improv)  
with percussionist Fabrizio Spera
recorded May 20, 2021

I am performing on my [custom improvisation software designed in SuperCollider](/research/module-tensor) which is also drawing sounds in real-time from my eurorack modular synthesizer.

# [_tap_](/works/tap) (2019)  
for percussion trio and multimedia
performed by Line Upon Line Percussion

**[full score](/scores/tap_-_score_210611_01__with_tech_diagram_.pdf)**

To ensure the synchronization of all four media (performers, tape, video, & lights) I developed an intermedia system to compose all aspects of the piece in the Reaper timeline. The tape part was constructed in Reaper, the instrumental parts were composed using MIDI triggered samples of drums, and the lights and video were controlled by typing commands of a custom API into Reaper timeline markers, which were then sent over OSC to SuperCollider, parsed and sent on to the lighting instruments and openFrameworks to play video.
